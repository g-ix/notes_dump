Question: I was actually thinking about why men, women, any entity, entire societies collapse when they get successful or really wealthy and starts wreaking chaos. 
Why they couldn’t stay wealthy even when they chaotic? What changes?
There’s an old saying that they needed to get humbled or they became egoistic, narcissistic, selfish, etc, but my question is why they had to meet destruction?
What’s at the quantum level?
From the above page of mine I shared, it feels like that happens because of diversion of purpose. 
They manifested everything in the universe for different purpose. And when they got it, after a while, their purpose shifted to entirely different frequency. 
They meant to create while they started destroying. 
Some people who just wants destruction also gets what they want and for them the destruction lasts way longer and if they starts creating, universe starts collapsing them and taking everything away from them because the purpose has changed, and so do the energies. 
But it’s quite complex and there are many variables and variations. 



CHATGPT RESPONSE:
Here’s a tight model—layered from physics → minds → firms → civilizations—showing why wealth/success so often drifts into chaos.

Why success drifts toward collapse

1) Thermodynamics: entropy never stops

Any stable order (a body, company, empire) is a dissipative structure: it stays ordered only by importing low-entropy resources and exporting heat/waste. When success removes constraints (easy money, status, surplus), systems relax their maintenance work. Entropy then wins by default.
Think: without constant “negentropy” work, information decays:
dI/dt = -lambda*I + u(t)

	•	I: organizational coherence/meaning
	•	\lambda: natural decay
	•	u(t): purposeful maintenance (learning, repair, discipline)
When wealth blunts urgency, u(t) (goes down) → I (goes down).

2) Control theory: the loss of a gradient

Systems learn by following gradients (errors, pain, scarcity). Wealth dampens error signals:
	•	Fewer consequences → poor feedback
	•	Delayed consequences → phase-lag (you correct too late)
	•	Saturated actuators → can’t steer (everyone powerful, no brakes)
No gradient ⇒ stagnation or oscillation. Practically: bad bets feel fine until the cliff.

3) Goodhart + wireheading: objectives get hijacked

“Hit the metric” replaces “serve the mission.” With resources, it’s easy to:
	•	Goodhart: optimize the proxy (stock price, clout) at the mission’s expense.
	•	Wirehead: route rewards directly to yourself (comfort, vanity) instead of through creation.
Creation → exploration cost; destruction/consumption → instant dopamine. The incentive field quietly flips.

4) Preference drift (hedonic + mimetic)

Success changes what feels “normal.”
	•	Hedonic adaptation: baseline rises; purpose dulls.
	•	Mimetic arms race: elites copy status signals, not real value—burning surplus on signaling wars.
Soon the organism exists to defend image, not produce value.

5) Evolutionary game theory: selection pressure reverses

Early stage: harsh selection → fitness builds (discipline, antifragility).
Late stage: insulation from stress → fragility accumulates (complacency, rent-seeking).
This is Tainter/Turchin in one line: complexity and elite overproduction inflate overhead until marginal returns go negative.

6) Information ecology: truth decay

Power concentrates narrative control. Without adversarial feedback, false beliefs compound:
	•	Yes-men filter errors.
	•	Censorship by comfort: nobody wants to be the messenger.
	•	Model drift: the map replaces the territory.
Collapse is often epistemic before it’s material.

“Quantum level” — what’s real vs. metaphor

You don’t need spooky quantum for this story. The useful import from physics is:
	•	Decoherence: open systems bleed coherence unless work restores it.
	•	Free-energy principle (metaphorically): organisms minimize surprise by updating models. If wealth lets you avoid reality-checks, you minimize surprise the wrong way—by editing perception, not improving the world. That’s stable… until it isn’t.

So yes—your “purpose divergence” is the right axis. When the objective shifts from creation → consumption/control, the system stops paying the energy/information cost of staying ordered. Entropy does the rest.

Why destructive actors sometimes last “longer”

Because destruction can release energy fast (plunder, war economies). It looks stable while it burns stored order (capital, trust, soil, credibility). It’s a high-thrust, low-endurance engine. Once stores deplete, the crash is sudden.

Anti-collapse protocol (for a person, company, or nation)
	1.	Purpose audit, quarterly. Write the mission in one sentence. Define two creation metrics (value delivered, learning gained) and one repair metric (debt reduced, defects fixed). If your calendar/spend doesn’t match—correct now.
	2.	Build hard feedback. Install adversarial friends (red team), open metrics, post-mortems. Tie rewards to outcomes in the wild, not vanity metrics.
	3.	Entropy budget. Allocate a fixed % (e.g., 20%) to maintenance: refactors, documentation, health, institutions, soil—whatever your domain’s “rails” are.
	4.	Skin in the game. Leaders keep exposure to the downside (time, reputation, money). Insulation breeds delusion.
	5.	Creation/consumption ratio. Track monthly. If consumption > creation for 90 days, expect drift → cut.
	6.	Periodic stress dosing. Choose constraints: fasts, shipping deadlines, live demos, competitive benchmarks. Voluntary stress preserves gradient without courting disaster.
	7.	Succession & renewal. Rotate authority; sunset stale processes. Make it cheaper to tell the truth than to maintain a lie.
	8.	Rituals of meaning. Daily/weekly practices that reconnect you to the mission (journaling, customer calls, service). Purpose is a muscle; train it.

Your notebook thesis, refined

Purpose is negentropy.
Systems remain coherent only while they convert energy into maintenance of meaning. Wealth reduces the pain of error, corrupts objectives into proxies, and dulls purpose; without deliberate counter-forces, entropy reclaims the structure.
