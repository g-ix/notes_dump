# ORIGIN:
The word "psychology" comes from two Greek words: psyche (meaning "soul," "mind," or "spirit") and logos (meaning "study of," "word," or "reason"). Combined, they form the "study of the mind". The term was first used in Latin by Marko Marulić around 1510–1520, and later gained more popular usage in the 17th and 18th centuries, eventually becoming established as a scientific discipline in the late 1800s.
