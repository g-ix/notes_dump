# ORIGIN:
The word "philosophy" originates from the ancient Greek words philosophia (φιλοσοφία), which combine philos (φίλος), meaning "love," and sophia (σοφία), meaning "wisdom". Therefore, philosophy literally means "love of wisdom". The term is believed to have been popularized by the philosopher Pythagoras, who distinguished himself as a "lover of wisdom" rather than a "wise man," emphasizing the ongoing pursuit of knowledge.
