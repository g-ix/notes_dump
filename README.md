# MY NOTES

On my journey to create ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence), I am on a path to learn various subjects and fields.

Possibly, these notes can help any one of you who are curious as well.

This repo is only for my notes related to various fields (including but not limited to):

1) Physics
2) Quantum
3) Biology
4) Chemistry
5) Software Architecture
6) Networking
7) Philosophy
8) Psychology
9) Artificial Intelligence ( AI )
10) Neural networks
11) Spirituality

There's a bonus folder: Union.

REASON FOR ITS EXISTENCE:
As per my understanding, to understand a subject at hand, even if it's the whole universe, we must segregate the subject into minute pieces. After that we must make sure not to stop as this would lead to narrow knowledge base and highly biased perspective of the world that a person perceives.

So, anyone on the path to understand the secrets of the universe, they must segregate the whole subject and then integrate the whole subject to understand the full depth of how the universe behaves at micro and macro scale.
