# ORIGIN:
The word "architecture" originates from the ancient Greek arkhitekton, which means "master builder". This is a compound of arkhi- ("chief") and tekton ("builder" or "creator"). The term was adopted into Latin as architectura and later passed into English through French, originally referring to the skilled person who designs and supervises the construction of buildings.
