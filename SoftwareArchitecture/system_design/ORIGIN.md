# ORIGIN:
The term "system design" comes from the Greek word systema for "organized whole," which evolved into the Latin systēma, and "design" from the Latin designare meaning "to mark out" or "plan". Its earliest known use in the 1920s reflected a general process of designing a complete system. In computing, the term emerged to describe the process of defining the architecture, components, and interfaces of a computer system.
