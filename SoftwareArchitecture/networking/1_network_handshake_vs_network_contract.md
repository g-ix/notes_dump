## Difference:
In networking, a network handshake and a network contract are fundamentally different concepts: the handshake is an automatic, technical process for establishing a connection, while a network contract is a formal, legal document outlining terms of service. 

## Network Handshake:

- *Definition*: A network handshake is an automated, technical process used by two physical or virtual devices to establish communication parameters and a reliable connection before any data is actually transferred. It is a core function of communication protocols like TCP and TLS.
- *Purpose*: The primary purpose is to negotiate parameters such as data transfer rates, security settings (like encryption keys and certificates), and sequence numbers, ensuring both sides are synchronized and ready to exchange data securely and reliably.
- *Mechanism*: It involves the exchange of specific, predefined control messages. The most common example is the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), a series of three steps to ensure a reliable connection is established.
- *Nature*: It is a low-level, technical process that happens in milliseconds without human intervention, ensuring the smooth flow of data in almost all online activities.

## Network Contract:

- *Definition*: A network contract (or network services agreement) is a formal, often extensive, written legal agreement between a network provider and a customer or between two companies (e.g., backbone providers, healthcare providers, or dental providers) that specifies the terms and conditions for network access, services, and payment.
- *Purpose*: Its purpose is to legally define the rights, responsibilities, costs, minimum terms, and service levels (e.g., in a Master Service Agreement) for all parties involved, protecting them from disputes and providing recourse if problems arise.
- *Mechanism*: It involves legal language, negotiation, and formal signatures. It serves as a documented reference in case of disagreements, non-compliance, or legal challenges.
- *Nature*: It is a high-level, business, or legal document that manages commercial and legal risk. The term "handshake agreement" is sometimes used informally to refer to a verbal or informal contract, which is generally not advised in formal business settings due to potential enforceability issues compared to a written contract.
