# DEFINITION
Quantum physics (also known as quantum mechanics) and quantum chemistry are two closely related fields that study the behavior of matter and energy on very small scales, primarily at the level of atoms, subatomic particles, and molecules. 
They diverge in their specific applications—quantum physics focuses on the fundamental laws governing the universe at the quantum scale, while quantum chemistry applies these principles to understand chemical behavior and molecular structure. Here's an overview:

# Quantum Physics
Quantum physics explores how particles, like electrons, protons, and photons, behave at incredibly small scales—where the classical laws of physics (Newton's laws) break down. At this scale, particles exhibit wave-particle duality, where they can behave like both particles and waves. Quantum mechanics introduces several revolutionary concepts:

---

## 1. Wave-Particle Duality:
Objects at the quantum level, such as electrons, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This is described by de Broglie's hypothesis, which suggests that all matter has a wavelength, particularly noticeable for small particles.

---

## 2. Quantum Superposition:
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured. This means, for example, that an electron can be in more than one place at the same time, a phenomenon famously illustrated by Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment.

---

## 3. Quantum Entanglement:
Entangled particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle directly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. This phenomenon was famously referred to as "spooky action at a distance" by Albert Einstein. Entanglement is the backbone of quantum computing and quantum communication.

## 4. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:
You cannot precisely know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The more accurately you know one, the less accurately you know the other. This limits the precision with which we can measure subatomic particles.

---

## 5. Quantization of Energy:
In the quantum world, energy is not continuous but comes in discrete units called "quanta." For example, light is composed of photons, each carrying a specific amount of energy depending on its frequency. This concept is the foundation of Planck's theory and the beginning of quantum theory.

## 6. The Schrödinger Equation:
This fundamental equation describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time. It’s a wave equation that calculates the probability amplitude of a particle's position and energy.
