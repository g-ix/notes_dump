# ORIGIN:
The word "quantum" comes from the Latin word quantus, meaning "how much" or "how great an extent". The term was first used in English in the 17th century to mean a "portion" or "amount". In physics, it was adopted to describe a specific, discrete amount of something, such as a photon being a "quantum" of light, and the term was most famously used in a 1924 paper by Max Born.
