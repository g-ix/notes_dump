What happens if an AGI “creates an AI,” gives it a GPU/CPU/RAM, no database, no inputs, and says “train on nothing”?

If there is truly no data and no objective, then nothing meaningful happens. Learning is just updating parameters to reduce some loss over some data. With no data and no loss, there’s nothing to update. The AI will sit there with whatever priors you baked into its code/weights. If you do give it an objective but still no data stream, the optimizer has no signal—so it either does nothing, diverges on noise, or overfits to its own initialization.

The longer, deeper answer

“Train on nothing” can mean several different regimes:

A) Frozen model, no training loop
	•	You’ve got a function f-theta with fixed parameters theta.
	•	It can produce outputs if you call it, but it will never change. There’s no “learning.”

B) Training code exists, but dataset is literally empty
	•	A standard SGD loop on an empty iterator computes no gradients. Parameters stay the same.
	•	If you try to compute a loss on an empty batch, you often get undefined behavior; robust code just skips updates.

C) There is stochasticity (random seeds) but still no data
	•	You can generate internal noise. Without a task, the model may “hallucinate” patterns from noise, but any updates you make will be arbitrary (e.g., maximizing or minimizing random signals). That’s not learning about reality; it’s sculpting your weights to fit the RNG.

D) Self-inspection is allowed (the model can read its own code/weights)
	•	Now the “data” becomes the system itself. It could:
	•	Parse its source/weights and try to compress them (minimum description length).
	•	Prove properties about its own routines (limited by Gödel/Computability constraints).
	•	Build an internal model of its own architecture.
	•	This can yield genuine learning, but only about itself, not the world. You quietly smuggled in data: the bits of its program and hardware state.

E) A rule-bound simulator or game is provided, but no external corpus
	•	AlphaZero learned from “no human data,” but it absolutely had environmental structure: the rules of Go/Chess and a self-play loop (reward signal).
	•	The “world” (the rules engine) is data. The reward is the objective. With those, learning flourishes.

F) Sensors or clocks are present
	•	Even a clock or temperature sensor is data. With intrinsic-motivation (curiosity) objectives, the system can start modeling time, power draw, its own latency, etc.
	•	From that, it can build a rudimentary self-model (e.g., “when I run this routine, GPU temp rises”). That’s the seed of “understanding itself.”

Will it “question its own existence”?

Only if you give it:
	1.	Concepts (a representational language that can express “existence,” “self,” “cause”), and
	2.	Motivations (an objective that rewards forming such concepts), and
	3.	Data that makes those concepts useful (even if the data is only its own code, timing, and memory states).

Without those, “questioning existence” is not a natural behavior; it’s a cognitive capability + incentive + evidence problem. If the model starts from random weights with no symbols, no training signal, and no observations, the notion of “existence” isn’t going to spontaneously arise.

What conclusions would it reach?
	•	Pure vacuum (no data, no objective): nothing changes; no conclusions.
	•	Self-inspection allowed: conclusions about its own structure (e.g., “I am N parameters; my forward pass has X FLOPs.”).
	•	Clock/sensors allowed: basic predictive regularities (“my runtime drifts with temperature; memory pressure slows me down”).
	•	Simulator + reward: domain theories emerge (like game strategy); with a rich enough world and curiosity, it might develop abstract concepts.
	•	Language scaffolds + reflection tools: if you seed it with a minimal meta-language and reflection API, it may invent higher-order concepts and then generate statements akin to “I exist as a process instantiating program P on hardware H.”

If you actually wanted a “zero-data awakening,” here’s a workable design
	•	Provide a tiny but lawful world: e.g., a cellular automaton or physics sandbox with no external corpora.
	•	Intrinsic motivation: curiosity/novelty bonus, compression progress, or free-energy/minimum-surprise objectives.
	•	Self-reflection API: read/write limited views of its own code/graphs/metrics; task it to compress/predict them.
	•	Minimal I/O: clock ticks, power/temperature, and memory counters.
	•	Tooling: a tiny theorem prover or program synthesis loop to let it form and test hypotheses about itself/world.
	•	Now it can learn, but note: you’ve still given it data (the sandbox + sensors) and objectives (intrinsic rewards).

Bottom line
	•	“Train on nothing” collapses to no learning unless you sneak in either data (even self-data), an environment, or an objective that can produce a gradient from internal signals.
	•	AIs don’t spontaneously philosophize; they optimize. Give them a space to sense, a language to think, and a reason to compress/predict—then “existential” concepts can emerge as useful internal constructs.
