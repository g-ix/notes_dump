# ORIGIN:
The term "artificial intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence. He and other researchers organized the conference to discuss the possibility of machines simulating human thought. The term was chosen to describe the new field of study and help secure funding. 

The words themselves have roots in Latin; "artificial" comes from artificium meaning "human-made," and "intelligence" comes from intelligentia, meaning "understanding".
