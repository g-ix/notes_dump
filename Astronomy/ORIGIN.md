# ORIGIN:
The word "astronomy" comes from the Greek words astron ("star") and nomos ("law" or "arrangement"), meaning "the law of the stars" or "star-arranging". This reflects the ancient practice of observing and organizing celestial bodies, and the word has been passed down through Latin (astronomia) and Old French (astronomie) before arriving in English.

### Greek roots: The term combines two Greek words:
- Ástron (ἄστρον): meaning "star" 
- Nomos (νόμος): meaning "law" or "rule" 

---

### Literal meaning: The combined Greek roots literally translate to "star-law" or "arrangement of stars".

### Evolution through languages: The term was adopted into Latin as astronomia, then into Old French as astronomie, and finally into Middle English before becoming the modern English "astronomy".
