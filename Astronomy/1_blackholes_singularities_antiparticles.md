QUESTION: Is it possible that the center of blackholes (singularities) are actually made of concentrated anti particles? and because it can be huge amount of antimatter, universe created such dense space and time that even light would keep travelling to the center and would never reflect anything is it would never come out. Basically, if there are anti-protons (which could possibly be accelerated to speed of light - photons- in the beginning of the universe), they would always stay stuck inside the blackholes until all life and all the resources have been depleted in the universe?

And once all the stars are gone, matter has been used, and only black holes are there, slowly they'll age, they'll start evaporating and their singularities, being full of antimatter, would come out where it will interfere with the matter, annihilate and create immense chaos, kick starting the universe.

As per my thoughts, is it possible?

this also makes it quite possible for time travelling black holes to exist, as whatever falls in the blackhole will not get annihilated, rather the quantum states flip and it just would be transferred where it's quantum state is compatible. And if we can somehow prove it, then for the time travelling space ships, all we have to do is material's quantum state shift and we might be able to travel through the black hole and eventually time travel.


CHATGPT RESPONSE:
Let’s stress-test it with what we (think we) know about black holes, antimatter, and quantum fields—then I’ll show you where speculation can still live.

TL;DR
	•	A black hole’s core is not meaningfully “made of antimatter.” Inside the horizon, the theory that best fits data (classical GR + QFT in curved spacetime) says: black holes are fully characterized—from the outside—by mass, charge, and spin (the no-hair theorem). They don’t preserve “matter vs antimatter” as an accessible label.
	•	Antimatter doesn’t gravitate differently and won’t make a qualitatively different singularity.
	•	Hawking evaporation doesn’t “release stored antimatter”; it emits an almost thermal spectrum determined by the hole’s mass/spin/charge.
	•	“Time-travel via black holes” runs into inner-horizon instabilities, cosmic censorship, and the need for exotic negative energy to keep anything traversable.

Now the details—fast and precise.

⸻

1) “Singularity made of antimatter?”
	•	Gravity doesn’t care about charge sign. Antimatter has positive inertial/gravitational mass; it falls in like matter. So piling in antiparticles doesn’t create a special “antimatter singularity.”
	•	No-hair: Outside the horizon, the only classical labels are M, J, Q. Baryon number, lepton number, “this was antimatter,” etc., are not encoded in the classical exterior solution. If you throw in 10^60 antiprotons, you just increase M (and temporarily Q if you keep it charged, but see below).
	•	Rapid neutralization: A highly charged hole attracts opposite charges from the environment and neutralizes quickly via discharge and pair production. So even net electric charge tends to bleed off; let alone “antimatter character,” which is not a conserved exterior label.

Bottom line: There’s no consistent way—within standard GR/QFT—to call a singularity “made of antimatter” as a physical, observable fact.

⸻

2) “Light can’t escape because antimatter is dense”—not the mechanism
	•	The reason light can’t escape is the event horizon: a global causal boundary where all future-directed null geodesics move deeper in. It’s a geometric property of spacetime curvature, not a reflective/absorptive material effect or annihilation.
	•	Annihilation (matter + antimatter → photons) would actually produce gamma rays, but nothing gets out from inside the horizon anyway.

⸻

3) “At the end, antimatter comes out and reboots the cosmos”
	•	Hawking radiation is produced by quantum fields near the horizon, not by the core burping out its contents. The spectrum is almost thermal, with particle/antiparticle pairs produced symmetrically, biased only by conserved charges (generally ~0 for astrophysical holes).
	•	Evaporation times are obscene: a stellar-mass black hole takes ~10^67 years; supermassive ones, ~10^99+ years. The late flash is intense but tiny compared to a Big Bang and not antimatter-specific.
	•	There’s no known mechanism where “stored antimatter” explodes out and seeds a new universe. (Speculative bounce cosmologies exist, but they don’t hinge on antimatter content, and they need quantum gravity we don’t yet have.)

⸻

4) “Maybe early anti-protons reached light speed, became photons?”
	•	A massive particle (any proton/antiproton) can asymptotically approach c, but never equal it. Photons are massless spin-1 quanta; an antiproton is massive spin-1/2. They are different excitations of different fields; one doesn’t “turn into” the other by simply speeding up. (They can annihilate to photons with a partner, but that’s a process, not a speed limit trick.)

⸻

5) Could black holes enable time travel?
	•	Kerr (rotating) solutions have regions with closed timelike curves deep inside and an inner horizon. Tempting!
	•	But the inner horizon is believed to be nonlinearly unstable (“mass inflation”): tiny perturbations blow up curvature, wrecking the smooth passage. Realistic astrophysical infall + quantum effects make traversability not credible.
	•	Traversable wormholes (actual shortcuts) require exotic negative energy that must be arranged and sustained with extreme precision. We don’t have a physically realizable way to do that at macroscopic scale.
	•	Changing your “quantum state” won’t sync you to a new timeline; states evolve via local unitary dynamics constrained by the geometry and energy conditions.

6) Where your intuition does touch real frontiers
	•	Information problem: Black holes scramble and radiate information thermally (apparently). Modern results (entanglement “islands”, Page curve) suggest unitarity is preserved, but it’s subtle. This is a legitimate “deep end” where new physics (quantum gravity) is still emerging.
	•	Pair production near horizons: You intuited photons spawning e⁻/e⁺ pairs—yes, vacuum fluctuations and strong fields do that. This underlies Hawking and Schwinger processes.
	•	“Flip” of labels: Inside strong curvature, our usual particle labels get fuzzy; what counts as “particle/antiparticle” is observer- and frame-dependent in curved spacetime. That’s a real QFT-in-curved-spacetime fact—but it does not produce controlled time travel or antimatter cores.

⸻

7) If you want a “cosmic reboot” story that stays nearer to physics
	•	Black-hole → baby-universe ideas (Smolin’s cosmological natural selection, various bounce/match proposals) posit that singularities could be replaced by quantum bounces, spawning new expanding regions. Entirely speculative, but it targets the right layer (quantum gravity), not antimatter stocking.
	•	Asymptotic safety / loop quantum gravity / string-inspired bounces: Some models resolve singularities by discrete geometry or higher-order effects. None are experimentally confirmed yet.

⸻

8) A crisp mental model to keep
	•	Outside view: A black hole is a 3-number object (M, J, Q). It scrambles inputs and re-emits long after as nearly thermal radiation governed by horizon geometry.
	•	Inside view (unknown): Classical singularity is a signal of theory breakdown. We don’t know the microstructure, but nothing we do know supports “antimatter cores” or controlled time-travel channels.
	•	Antimatter: Same gravity as matter. Its distinctive feature is charge/quantum numbers, not spacetime response. Black holes erase those labels from the exterior (no-hair), and don’t selectively exhale antimatter.

⸻

9) Where to push next (if you want to sharpen this into a testable theory)
	•	Replace “antimatter core” with a quantum-gravity microstate ansatz (e.g., fuzzballs, gravastars, firewalls) and ask: what observable signature (ringdown spectrum deviations? echoes in gravitational waves? deviations in Hawking flux late-time correlations?)
	•	Frame “time travel” as traversable wormhole engineering: what negative-energy budgets are required (Casimir arrangements), and can semiclassical quantum inequalities be satisfied?
	•	Explore unitarity + Page curve: if info is preserved, what correlation structure should late-time Hawking quanta show? That’s closer to something we could, in principle, constrain.

⸻

Verdict on your proposal

Beautifully creative, but as stated it conflicts with:
	•	no-hair + charge neutralization,
	•	antimatter’s identical gravitational behavior,
	•	Hawking radiation’s nearly thermal, non-“stored antimatter” character,
	•	instabilities that thwart “time-travel black holes.”
