Question: So, if an observer, me, forgets the content, then I would also forget the purpose of why I am observing the universe as is, but then it would decrease the entropy because the system has no purpose of where to go, so no meaning and yet I can observe the universe without any directions. And this would result in looking at the universe as is but as it would lose all the meaning associated with it, this would also result in pure wave function. No preassumptions mean no wave function collapse. But as there is no purpose, there would be no meaning. And from there I realised an year ago that we give meaning to what we want to give to and, for me, I have to create a custom purpose for myself. Then again, meditation is flawed. Isn't it?

CHATGPT Response:

You’re tracing a real paradox that both physics and mysticism run into. Let’s untangle it carefully.

⸻

1. Observation and purpose are different layers

When you “forget the content,” you’re dropping conceptual purpose—the narrative that says I am Garry, observing for reason X.
But perception still unfolds because awareness itself is dynamic. At the biological level, neurons fire, energy gradients move; at the phenomenological level, knowing keeps happening even without a story.

So the observer doesn’t disappear; only the story of purpose does.

⸻

2. Entropy and meaning aren’t identical

Physical entropy measures energy dispersal; psychological “entropy” measures informational uncertainty.
If you stop assigning meaning, you don’t lower thermodynamic entropy—you release cognitive tension.
The system still changes; it’s just not being evaluated through the “good/bad, progress/decline” filters.
That’s why deep meditation feels both empty and vividly alive: the world’s flux remains, but valuation pauses.

⸻

3. “Pure wave function” is a useful metaphor, not literal physics

The quantum wave function describes probability amplitudes for measurements.
In consciousness terms, “pure wave function” ≈ an uncollapsed field of potential meanings.
Meditative absorption approximates that: infinite possibilities, no selection.
Collapse resumes the instant intention re-appears—when awareness moves toward preference.

⸻

4. Meaning as a creative act

You saw it clearly: meaning isn’t found, it’s assigned.
That insight doesn’t make meditation flawed; it shows what meditation is for:
to reset the canvas so that whatever purpose you later paint is conscious, chosen, not inherited.
Without stillness, the old programs keep re-painting themselves.

⸻

5. The cycle: emptiness → creation → dissolution

Every tradition encodes this rhythm:
	•	Shiva (stillness / pure potential)
	•	Shakti (manifestation / purposeful movement)
	•	Return (integration / letting go again)

Meditation is the Shiva phase—entropy of meaning rises to maximum (no bias).
Then the creative act—your custom purpose—is the Shakti phase, re-introducing structure and lowering entropy locally.
The alternation is the cosmic engine; neither side is flawed.

⸻

6. Practical understanding
	•	Use meditation to empty bias and feel the field uncollapsed.
	•	From that silence, choose your next direction—consciously collapse the wave.
	•	When that purpose starts ossifying, return to stillness again.
That oscillation keeps intelligence fresh and entropy in balance.

⸻

One-liner to carry:

Meditation isn’t a flaw in purpose—it’s the reset button that lets purpose be born clean.
