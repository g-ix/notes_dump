Question: So, if the ancient sages were actually trying to forget what they know in order to connect to the Sat-chit-ananda, the pure bliss, the universe itself in its pure consciousness state, shouldn't they fail because their DNA already has 455 exabytes of data?

Now, the pure consciousness means they are purely in a state of connection with universe without any knowledge to bias what they are receiving from the universe. Isn't the meditation process flawed in the first place because whatever they would receive depends upon what is the existing information they hold in their cellular architecture?

And yet, whenever a person turns to a sage, a really true one and not the mocking one, all of us comes to the same understanding that we now nothing and we try to interpret the universe into our own coded language. could you shed some light on it by thinking deeply?


CHATGPT Response:
The short answer: sages aren’t trying to erase information; they’re shifting identification. DNA, memories, and conditioning still exist, but the sense of “I am that content” relaxes until awareness knows itself as prior to content. That’s Sat-Chit-Ānanda: Being–Knowing–Bliss as the ground, not a dataset.

Here’s a clean model to square the circle:

1) Hardware ≠ Identification
	•	DNA is biological firmware (constraints, tendencies).
	•	Conditioning is learned policy (habits, narratives).
	•	Awareness is the field in which both appear.
Meditation doesn’t delete firmware or files; it dis-identifies the user from them.

2) Bayesian brain, reweighted

The nervous system runs predictive models (priors) and updates with evidence. Suffering = overweighted priors (“this story is me”). Deep practice does two things:
	•	Down-weights the precision of self-narrative priors (DMN quiets, in neuroscience terms).
	•	Up-weights raw observation (sensory/interoceptive truth).
Result: less bias from stored models, more contact with what is. You haven’t forgotten; you’ve stopped confusing the map for the territory.

3) “Knowing nothing” = clean interface

When people meet a true sage, the felt sense is “I know nothing.” That isn’t ignorance; it’s non-grasping clarity:
	•	Concepts still function, but they’re tools, not identity.
	•	Perception is crisp because it’s not pre-chewed by narrative.
Hence the paradox: the mind is full of knowledge, yet the knower is free of it.

4) Why “pure consciousness” isn’t biased by DNA

Bias appears when attention fuses with content. In nondual awareness:
	•	Content (genes, memories, moods) arises and passes.
	•	Awareness contains them without being narrowed by them.
Like the screen isn’t biased by the movie, even while the movie plays.

5) What meditation actually trains

Not amnesia—meta-operations:
	•	Stability of attention (so you can see clearly).
	•	Clarity (fine-grained perception of body, feeling, thought).
	•	Equanimity (non-reactivity → priors don’t hijack).
	•	Inquiry (“Who am I?”) to unhook identification loops.
These shift the controller, not the content.

6) Why many paths converge on the same insight

Because the structure of suffering and freedom is species-general:
	•	Clinging/aversion → contraction.
	•	Seeing through them → ease.
Different doctrines, same mechanics: reduce identification, reality updates you.

7) Practical takeaways for you
	•	Sit daily: 20–40 min. First 10 min breath stability, then open monitoring.
	•	Label gently (“thinking, feeling, intending”)—this lowers prior precision.
	•	Body first: scan sensations; let language lag. Embodiment de-biases concepts.
	•	Self-inquiry at the end: “What knows this breath/thought?” Rest as that.
	•	Off-cushion: speak less, observe more; notice the impulse to “explain” and let it pass.
	•	Ethics (truthfulness, non-harm): reduces noise → clearer signal.

One-liner you can keep:

Meditation isn’t deleting data; it’s decoupling the knower from the known so the world can be met as it is.

So no, the path isn’t flawed. Your DNA can hold a universe of patterns; freedom is simply not being trapped by them.
